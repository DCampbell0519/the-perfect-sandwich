# How To Make The Perfect Sandwich

Making the perfect sandwich is as much art, as it is science.  I mean sure, there's something inherently American about being able to slap anything between two slices of whatever-the-fudge bread and calling it a *sandwich*.  But there's a big difference between that sorry excuse of a man-dinner, and culinary magic.  And look, I get that the idea of "The Perfect Sandwich is *subjective,* and everyone has their own idea of what constitutes said *perfection,* but let me be the first to tell you... 

... They're wrong.  

## 1. The Bread

```javascript
const myBread = sourdough;
console.log(myBread + " is the only bread worth breading.")
``` 

> PRO TIP: Melt a little butter to the outsides of your sourdough.  Turn that bad boy into a grilled-cheese-style man-wich!

## 2. The Spread

The spread is probably the most subjective of the ingredients available to you.  Mayhaps that tub of full-fat *mayo* gets the nostalgic juices flowing, reminiscent of weekends at Grandma's when you were young and enjoyed the immortality of youth.  Mayhaps you watched a lot of Buffy The Vampire Slayer at a formative age and think a nice *Garlic Aioli* is the way to go.  Or perhaps you're like me and enjoy a nice kick.  A nice *creamy horseradish* is the way to go!

```javascript
const mySpread = ["Garlic Aioli", "Mayo"];

for (let i = 0; i < mySpread.length; i++) {
  if (i < 1) {
    mySpread.push("Horseradish");
    }
}
console.log(mySpread);
```

## 3. Meat and Cheese
